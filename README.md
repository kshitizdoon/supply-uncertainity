# supply-uncertainity
This is an ongoing project based on Operations Management. We consider the procurement problem of a retailer who outsources from multiple(k) suppliers 
This project aims to model the impact of a **contingeny** on the optimal order quantity for the retailer 
In order to have a close look at the impact of contingency, we introduce constraints on type-1 and type-2 service levels
We introduced various scenarios in which either 0,1,2,...k suppliers meet the contingency 
We consider the constraints on the type 1 service level in each of the above described scenarios
We tried to find the effect of an increase in the number of suppliers on the optimal order quantity
We tried to model the situation using additive and multiplicative models of supply uncertainity
